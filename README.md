Project Name: Bag Tracker - Innovative Bag Tracking Solution

Description
Bag Tracker is an innovative startup project that aims to provide a convenient and reliable bag tracking solution for travelers. The idea behind Bag Tracker is to offer an intelligent tagging system, called iTags, which can be attached to bags. These iTags will enable users to track their bags using a dedicated mobile application.

To use the Bag Tracker service, customers will need to purchase the iTags and subscribe to the app. The app will allow users to log in and seamlessly track their bags in real-time. In case a bag gets lost or misplaced, the app will send notifications to the user, ensuring proactive measures can be taken to retrieve the bag promptly.
